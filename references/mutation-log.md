## Mutation 1 — 2026-05-22

**Session**: Initial creation of viable-swarm-model skill
**File**: `SKILL.md`, `references/*`, `assets/*`
**Type**: create
**Rationale**: The skill was originally designed as a static instruction set.
A learning organism cannot have immutable DNA. All files must be mutable,
with regulated mutation rules, self-test at Phase 0, and a mutation log.
**Expected effect**: Future sessions will load a skill that can evaluate its
own performance and append new prevention rules, patterns, and anti-patterns
based on empirical results. The skill evolves between sessions.

## Mutation [N] — YYYY-MM-DD

**Session**: [Brief description of the task/session]
**File**: [Which file was modified]
**Type**: [append | edit | strikethrough | structural]
**Rationale**: [What empirical finding motivated this change. Be specific:
which build, which bug, which false positive, which missed vulnerability.]
**Expected effect**: [How the next session should behave differently because
of this mutation. What should be caught that wasn't? What should pass that
was falsely flagged?]
